# 🧮 Tiny Calculator That Tries Its Best

This is a **very simple calculator** made with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It’s not fancy.  
It’s not smart.  
But it *does math* and that’s already impressive.

Built purely for **learning**, breaking things, fixing them, and saying  
“ohhh, that’s how it works”.

## 🎉 What Can It Do?

- ➕ Add numbers (math!)
- ➖ Subtract numbers (still math!)
- ✖️ Multiply numbers (wow)
- ➗ Divide numbers (careful with zero 😬)
- 🔄 Reset itself when things get weird

## 🧠 Why This Exists

- To practice **HTML structure**
- To mess around with **CSS styling**
- To finally understand **JavaScript logic**
- To break it, fix it, and learn something new every time

No frameworks. No libraries. No stress.

## 🧩 Tech Stack (aka the basics)

- **HTML** – the bones
- **CSS** – the drip 💅
- **JavaScript** – the brain 🧠

## 📂 File Chaos (aka structure)
